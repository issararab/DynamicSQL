# DynamicSQL
The repository shows the power of SQL in creating parametrized SQL scripts which might allow you to combine similar, yet different, scripts to perform different tasks in one single SQL script based on input parameters. Innitially, a client had 21 large seperate scripts that he had to run on a regular bases. Maintaining them was hard, so I suggested this solution which combines all in one. The client had to add a second division which would expand the repository with an extra 10 more scripts. In this example, we just had to add it as a parameter. To achieve such goal, the architecture and schema of all input tables had to be redesigned.
